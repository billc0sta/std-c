# std-c
my implementation of the C20 standard library

this library is highly unportable, as it only adheres to these specifications
- The NT kernel syscalls
- big-endian byte order
- IEEE 754 floating-point representation

## supported
- string.h
- ctype.h

I intend to support all the available standard libraries as if C20.

__UNUSABLE: Still Under Development__
